        <h1>Dead Girl</h1> <br>
<p>
Outside the funeral home, I heard a boy say that she had fallen off the back of her boyfriend’s motorcycle.<br>
Broken her neck. <strong> She never knew what hit her,</strong> he said. I was 13.
The dead girl had been a junior in high school.<br>

<br>The line to see her snaked around the building. <strong>boy with long hair, wearing ties they’d borrowed from their fathers</strong>,<br>
and girls with thick blue eyeshadow smoked cigarettes in the parking lot.<br>
Someone passed a bottle of Jack. There were no adults there, just very old kids.</p>

<p1 > She almost looked like she was sleeping, except that she was too still.<br>
There was a puffiness to her face that didn’t seem quite right. They had dressed her for the prom; the crinoline sleeves of her gown like poofs of pink cotton candy.<br> Some kids prayed, but I couldn’t. I just stared at the roses in her corsage.</p1>
